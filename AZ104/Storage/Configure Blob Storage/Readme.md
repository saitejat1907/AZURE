## üìÑ Description
Welcome to my **AZ-104 certification series**! In this video, we dive deep into **Azure Blob Storage**, a key component of the Azure Storage module. Understanding Azure Blob Storage is crucial for the AZ-104 exam and plays an essential role in managing unstructured data efficiently in the cloud.

### What You'll Learn:
- **Introduction to Azure Blob Storage**:
  - Overview of Blob Storage and its importance in handling unstructured data such as text files, images, videos, backups, and logs.
  - Use cases like streaming data, archiving, data distribution, and access from Azure services and on-premises environments.

- **Implementation of Azure Blob Storage**:
  - Detailed steps to create Blob Storage accounts, set up containers, and upload blobs.
  - Explained **basic rules** such as no limit on the number of blobs and containers.

- **Blob Types**:
  - **Block Blobs**: Ideal for storing large files like images, documents, and media files. Supports parallel uploads, making it suitable for large datasets.
  - **Append Blobs**: Designed for scenarios where data is frequently appended, like log files.
  - **Page Blobs**: Optimized for frequent read/write operations, mainly used for storing Virtual Machine disks (VHDs).

- **Blob Access Tiers**:
  - Explained the four access tiers: **Hot**, **Cool**, **Cold** (recently added), and **Archive**.
  - Detailed analysis of scenarios for using each tier and their associated costs.
  - **Cold Tier**: Minimum storage duration of 90 days, suitable for long-term storage with less frequent access.

- **Lifecycle Management Rules**:
  - How to set up lifecycle management policies to automatically move data between access tiers based on defined rules.
  - Cost-saving strategies by transitioning blobs to lower-cost tiers as their access frequency decreases.

- **Blob Object Replication**:
  - Importance of replicating blobs across different regions to improve data availability and disaster recovery.
  - Key considerations for setting up replication: latency reduction, compute efficiency, and cost optimization.

- **Tools for Blob Storage Management**:
  - **Azure Storage Explorer**: A graphical tool for managing Blob Storage from a desktop environment.
  - **AzCopy**: A command-line tool for fast and efficient data transfers.
  - **Azure Data Box Disk**: Physical devices provided by Azure to transfer large volumes of data when network bandwidth is a constraint.

- **Blob Versioning**:
  - Explained how to enable and use blob versioning to maintain previous versions of a blob, protecting against accidental deletion or overwriting.
  
- **Blob Storage Pricing**:
  - Factors influencing Blob Storage costs: access tier selection, read/write operations, data transfer, and replication settings.
  - Tips for optimizing Blob Storage costs based on usage patterns and access requirements.
